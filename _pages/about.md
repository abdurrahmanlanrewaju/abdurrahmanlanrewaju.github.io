I hold a B.Sc. in Multimedia and an M.Sc. in Information Technology from Universiti Utara Malaysia (Northern University of Malaysia), where I developed a strong interest in Human-Computer Interaction and Health & Wellbeing applications. 

I am working towards a PhD in Data Analytics and Society within the Department of Social Statistics at the University of Manchester. My interdisciplinary research integrates statistical, computational, and social science approaches. It focuses on the methodological challenges of using the Smartphone Experience Sampling Method to investigate how regenerated urban public realm impact subjective wellbeing. 

The broad title of the research is the Impact of Urban Environmental Factors on Momentary Subjective Wellbeing (SWB) using Smartphone-Based Experience Sampling Methods. The overall question that the research will attempt to answer is: How can the platform, associated functionality, and database of registered users at King's Cross be used to investigate the impact of the urban neighbourhood environment on the momentary SWB via an Experience Sampling Method?

Research questions:
1. Which randomized incentives are the most effective in recruiting and maintaining a neighbourhood population to use ESM to share momentary SWB data?
2. What is the acceptability of using smartphone ESM to collect momentary SWB data from a neighbourhood population?
3. How do different urban public space environments in the King's Cross neighbourhood influence momentary SWB?

The PhD is being advised by a Biostatistician with expertise in Experience Sampling Methods, [Lesley-Anne Carter](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/lesley-anne.carter), an Urban Health Pyschologist, [Jack Benton](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/jack.benton), and a Geographer and Urban Wellbeing Lead for Brent Cross, London, [Jamie Anderson](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/jamie.anderson).
