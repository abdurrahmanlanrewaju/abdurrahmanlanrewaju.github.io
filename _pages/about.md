I am working towards a PhD in Data Analytics and Society within the Department of Social Statistics at the University of Manchester. I hold a B.Sc. in Multimedia and an M.Sc. in Information Technology from Universiti Utara Malaysia (Northern University of Malaysia), where I developed a strong interest in Human-Computer Interaction and Health & Wellbeing applications. My interdisciplinary PhD, which integrates statistical, computational, and social science approaches, focuses on the methodological challenges of using the Smartphone Experience Sampling Method to investigate how regenerated urban public realm impact subjective wellbeing. The PhD is being advised by a Biostatistician with expertise in Experience Sampling Methods, [Lesley-Anne Carter](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/lesley-anne.carter), an Urban Health Pyschologist, [Jack Benton](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/jack.benton), and an Urban Geographer and Urban Wellbeing Lead for Brent Cross, London, [Jamie Anderson](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/jamie.anderson).
