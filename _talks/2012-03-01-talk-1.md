The Department of [Social Statistics](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/social-statistics/) where I am pursuing my PhD at the University of Manchester held its away day at [HOME](https://homemcr.org/), in central Manchester. The event was a resounding success, fostering a collegial environment where important discussions flourished. 

Key themes included research collaborations within the department and support for early career academics. The dayâ€™s activities not only sparked meaningful conversations but also played a crucial role in shaping the future direction of the department.

I presented a 10-minute overview of my PhD research at the event and received questions from the faculty members at the end.
